Basically it helps you run commands you would use every day, but faster (because you don't have to type a lot)

Note: for now this only contains an `nmap` parser, but soon enough it will have every script you would normally use

Process is simple: RUN > PARSE > SAVE > VIEW

## Shell

Your shell is by default: 
```
T:  targetHere % 
```
You can change it in `./src/bhssettings.py`

## Commands

- target [your target]
    - Run this every time you open bhs, it will set the target
- store v
    - View available stores
- ports
    - View the ports store
- nmap
    - Run nmap against the target

- add dirbust parser
